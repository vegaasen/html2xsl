# HTML2XSL-conversion with Java/w3c DOM

## Introduction

When I was working with XSLTs with Tridion, I suddenly discovered how we were working @ Telenor. We had our "daily" practise with
converting prototypes created in html into xsl. Quite much work right there!

So, the intention was _fairly_ easy. Use java to help me convert html into xsl *on the fly*. This is an ongoing "project" of mine that
must not be considered as über-serious, as I guess there will not be many people using this.. Please leave any comments if you'd like!

## Intention

* Help myself when working with the conversion of html into xsl.
* ..?
